# 🪞 Palindrome Checker

A simple web-based Palindrome Checker built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project allows users to enter a word, phrase, or number to check whether it reads the same backward as forward.

## 🧠 What is a Palindrome?
A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same backward and forward.  
For example:  
- `racecar`  
- `madam` 
- `A man, a plan, a canal: Panama`

---

## 💻 Features
- Checks if the input text is a palindrome.  
- Ignores case sensitivity, punctuation, and spaces.  
- Provides instant feedback when you click the **Check** button.  
- Alerts user if no input is entered.  
- Clean and responsive UI.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – for structure  
- **CSS3** – for styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – for logic and interactivity

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user enters text into the input box.  
2. When the **Check** button is clicked:
   - The input is cleaned (spaces, punctuation, and casing removed).  
   - The cleaned string is reversed and compared to the original.  
3. A message displays whether it’s a palindrome or not.

## ⚙️ What I have Learned
1. How to manipulate strings using JavaScript methods
  -.split(), .reverse(), .join() for reversing text.
  -.replace() and regex for cleaning up input.
2. Using conditionals (if...else) to compare strings and display results.
3. Breaking a problem into smaller logical steps.
4. Debugging issues using console.log() effectively.
5. Testing different edge cases like numbers, spaces, and capitalization.
6. Directly modify an element's inline styles using the style property
7. Improved my understanding of user input handling
